I did a simple accounting program for an accountant.

Tools and technologies used:

- Python
- Pycharm


This program reads some csv files which is generated from an gouvernamental web application and based on them this program extract and process some data.

This is the template. For evrey input csv file the script will create an output file with filename composed from First two letters of the 'Cod unic' column and last 7 digit of 'Cod unic' column from csv input file.
